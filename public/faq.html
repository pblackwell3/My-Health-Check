        How do you determine my health risk from the MyPH HealthChek©
        Questionnaire? All of the information requested in MyPH HealthChek©
        survey is used to determine your current health risks. An individual’s
        health risk is usually related to many factors, including:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li class="bullets2">your Age Group;</li>
        <li class="bullets2">your place of Residence (where you live);</li>
        <li class="bullets2">your Occupational Exposures;</li>
        <li class="bullets2">your personal Health History;</li>
        <li class="bullets2">your Family History of health problems;</li>
        <li class="bullets2">your Personal Habits.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The answer to each of the numbered questions in the survey is assigned a
        numerical value. Your relative health risk is determined by your total
        numerical score. Please answer all questions to allow us to better help
        you determine your health risks.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >How do you determine what value is assigned to the answer to a
          particular question in the survey?</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The numerical value that is assigned to each of the answers in the
        Questionnaire is determined by recommendations from the MyPH Medical
        Advisory Board. The MyPH Medical Advisory Board is composed of
        healthcare practitioners from a wide spectrum of Primary Care and
        Medical Specialties, with more than 1000 years of combined experience in
        caring for patients. You should be aware that preventive health
        recommendations may change from time to time, depending on
        recommendations from CDC, WHO and your Federal, State and Local health
        authorities.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >What do you do with the information that I provide in the
          survey?</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The information that is collected in this health survey is used to
        compare your individual health risks to national health standards and to
        the results of all the other people in your age group that completed the
        MyPH HealthChek© survey. (For example: the results of your HealthChek©
        survey may show that you rated in the top 25 percent of all the people
        in your age group that completed the survey in meeting the current
        recommended preventive healthcare guidelines from recognized health
        authorities). MyPH HealthChek© team provides you with this information
        in the hope that you and your doctor will use the information to improve
        your health and reduce your healthcare costs).
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        We always encourage to work closely with your Primary Care doctor to
        manage your preventive health. If you request additional health
        information from the MyPH HealthChek© team after you have completed your
        survey, the results of your survey may be used as a guide to direct you
        to additional health resources.

      <p></p>
      <p>
        Many health conditions are related to your Age, your Sex, your
        Occupation and/ or to your customary place of residence (the place where
        you live or have spent most of your life). For example, if you live in
        New York City, you may have a different set of health risks than if you
        lived in rural Kansas. Your Demographic information will help us to
        provide you with a more accurate assessment of your health risks.
